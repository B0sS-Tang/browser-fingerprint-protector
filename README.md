# Browser Fingerprint Protector

## How it works

The extension protects the information in `window.navigator` and HTTP request headers to complicate browser fingerprinting.

* Completely hides `mimeTypes` and `plugins`.
* Pretends that you only have `English US` language.
* Pretends that you use `Windows 10`.
